    <div><p><h1 class="tat">The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking, and Jane Wilde the arts student <br>
      he fell in love with whilst studying at Cambridge in the 1960s. Little was expected from Stephen Hawking,<br>
       a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, given just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at 21 years of age.<br>
       He became galvanized, however, by the love of fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde,<br>
       and he went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children. <br>
      Over the course of their marriage as Stephen's body collapsed and his academic renown soared,<br>
       fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives.</h1></p></div>
